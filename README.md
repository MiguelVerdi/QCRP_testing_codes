# QCRP test code repository

This folder contains the general procedure to simulate the experiment QCRP, the same was tested in a virtual machine with Ubuntu `20.04.6` with a `ns3.33` software, the procedure is described in detail as follows.

- There are 4 types of scenarios `*` = Dense, Sparse, Usparse, Vsparse
- There are 4 types of algorithms `**` = AODV,NPCA,PQGR,DGGR
  
- Each scenario is described by a file with `.mat` data that was generated by an external program. 
These are located in the `ExperimentDataFiles\Routing_compare_0922` file and are described as `highway*_**.mat`, these will be the files you start working with. 

##Proposed algorithm


- Each of the `ExperimentDataFiles\Routing_compare_0922\highway*_**.mat` files is processed in Matlab Online using the file named `ExperimentPrograms\DataProcessingFiles\ExperimentmToCSVComparison.m`, you only have to copy paste the code in matlab and charge the file after running the program, it would ask for the file, this generates the files found in `ExperimentDataFiles` which are `ExperimentFiles\**\highway*_**.csv` files, containing the data from the .mat file but unpacked so that C++ can read them in a more orderly.

##Comparision with other algorithms
- There are 4 types of scenarios `*` = AODV,NPCA,PQGR,DGGR

- Each of the `InputFiles\Ruting_compare_0922\highway*_**.mat` files is processed in Matlab Online using the file named `ExperimentDataFiles\Routing_compare_09\ExperimentmToCSVProposed.m`, you only have to copy paste the code in matlab and charge the file after running the program, it would ask for the file, this generates the files found in `ExerimentDataFiles` which are `ExperimentDataFiles\**\highway*_**.csv` files, containing the data from the .mat file but unpacked so that C++ can read them in a more orderly.

- There is an special kind of experiment called DGGR, the files are found in `ExperimentFiles/DGGR/highway*_DGGR.mat` this file is processed in `ExperimentPrograms\DataProcessingFiles\ExperimentmToCSVDGGR.m` you only have to copy paste the code in matlab and charge the file after running the program, it would ask for the file, this generates the files found in `ExerimentDataFiles` which are `ExperimentDataFiles/**/highway*_**.csv` files, containing the data from the .mat file but unpacked so that C++ can read them in a more orderly.

- These `ExperimentDataFiles/highway*_PQGR.csv` files are the input for the main C++ simulation, to run this file you must have installed the simulation software `ns3.33` and in the `ns-allinone-3.33/ns3-. 33` folder paste the `.csv` file, save the `ExperimentMain.cc` and `HighwayExperiment.h` program in `ns-allinone-3.33/ns3-.33/scratch` and to modify the input file you must specify it in the main function of `ExperimentMain.cc`.
  
- This experiment takes approximately 4 hours to run and generates the files `ExperimentResultFiles/highway*_PQGR_Result.csv`. 

- Finally this file is run in the python3 program `PlotFileExperiment.py` where you must specify in the file_path variable the file you want to display.
This generates the `ExperimentResultPlots/*/highway*_PQGR_Result_**_plot.png` files.

- Where ** = DataRate, Distance, Hops,Latency,PDR 

- In addition a final plot is generated with all these graphs together `ExperimentResultPlots/**/highway*_PQGR_Result_AllFigures.png`.

# General specifications of the simulation
- All the parameters can be changes in the `HighwayExperiment.h` for configurtion `HighwayExperiment::Configure()` 
## Simulation Time
Simulation time = 1s.

## Communication Specifications
- **Application Protocol:** onoff
- **Sending Rate:** 90Mbps
- **Max Packages:** 10,000 packages
- **Packet Size:** 500 bytes
- There is an special parameter called disconDistance that gives a lower bound for the cases the cars are to far, this case is 90 mts.
- It generates a multi-hop ad-hoc network in each experiment with static routing.

### Channel
- **Tx Power:** 35 dBm
- **Frequency:** 5.9GHz
- **Bandwidth:** 40MHz
- **Phy mode:** VhtMcs6

## Vehicle Classification
- **ID Format:** 4-numbers (type XXX)
- **Types:** 
  - 1 - Slow Vehicle
  - 2 - Normal Vehicle
  - 3 - Fast Vehicle
- Example: ID = 2012 represents vehicle 12 of normal velocity vehicles
- Special Vehicle with ID = 1 is the source vehicle

## IP Classification
- **Mask:** 255.255.255.0
- Networks between hops should be in the form 10.x.x.x
- Second position represents the sender's type (1,2,3)
- Third position represents the ID of the car without the class
- Fourth position represents the sender or receiver (2 for receiver, 1 for sender)
- Example: Car `3031` sending to car `2021`
In that case  the newtor io would be 10.3.31.0 and the sender would be IP(10.3.31.1) sending to receiver IP(10.3.32.2)
- If the source vehicle is sending, IP(10.0.1.x)

## Cars Simulation
- **Start Position and Start Velocity:** As the routing eval files.
- **Highway Specification:** 5Km.
- **Track of Highway:** 3.5mts

## Files `highway*_PQGR.mat` Unpack
- **Filename Format:** `highway*_PQGR.mat`
  - `*` = Dense, Sparse, Usparse, Vsparse

**Variables:**

- In direction, `0` means forward, `1` means backward.

## Data Writing
When running the simulation, the program generates a file `highway*_PQGR_simResults.csv` with the following headers:
